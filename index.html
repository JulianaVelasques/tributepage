        <h3>Who was Jesus Christ?</h3>
        <p>
          Jesus Christ was born circa 6 B.C. in Bethlehem. Little is known about his early life, but his life and his
          ministry are recorded in the New Testament, more a theological document than a biography. According to
          Christians, Jesus is considered the incarnation of God and his teachings are followed as an example for living
          a more spiritual life. Christians believe he died for the sins of all people and rose from the dead.
        </p>
        <h3>Background</h3>
        <p>
          Even as a young man, Jesus was teaching the word of God. At 12 years old, He taught in the temple, and all
          that heard Him were astonished at His understanding. When Jesus began His ministry, He fasted in the
          wilderness for 40 days. He was tempted by the devil and overcame that temptation. He was also baptized in the
          Jordan River by John the Baptist. Although Jesus was without sin, He was still baptized by immersion in order
          to teach us obedience to God. After Jesus’s baptism, God declared, “This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well
          pleased.”
        </p>
        <h3>Jesus' Ministry</h3>
        <p>
          It is believed that he began his ministry at age 30 when he was baptized by John the Baptist, who upon seeing
          Jesus, declared him the Son of God. After baptism, Jesus went into the Judean desert to fast and meditate for
          40 days and nights. The Temptation of Christ is chronicled in the Gospels of Matthew, Mark and Luke (known as
          the Synoptic Gospels).
        </p>
        <p>
          The Synoptic Gospels chronicle Jesus as he traveled through Judea and Galilee, using parables and miracles to
          explain how the prophecies were being fulfilled and that the kingdom of God was near. As word spread of
          Jesus's teaching and healing the sick and diseased, more people began to follow him. At one point, Jesus came
          to a level area and was joined by a great number of people. There, at the Sermon on the Mount, he presented
          several discourses, known as the Beatitudes, which encapsulate many of the spiritual teachings of love,
          humility and compassion.
